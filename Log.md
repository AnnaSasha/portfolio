<h1>Day 1: January 2nd, 2017</h1>

Today's Progress: Deleted slider, instead created 6 block section with future projects. Added tribute page to past projects. Tried to use bootstrap but it messed whole markup. 

Thoughts: Cannot understand why after resizing text comes out of the borders, trying to understand the bug, will read about float and em. 

Work on in the future: Bootstrap. Understanding github. Fixing issue with out of borders text

<h1>Day 2: January 3rd, 2017</h1>

<h1>Day 3: January 4th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: practising Javascript and selectors.

Thougts: Javascript is very difficult for me, but not because I am stupid but because I cannot grasp the whole idea behind the language. Once I do, everything will be much easier. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness and Bootstrap+ Javascript and pseudo-elements which fascinate me

<h1>Day 4: January 5th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: struggling with footer and mirroring images - it appeares that easier to mirror it in Photoshop than CSS.

Thougts: Every day I want to spend more than 1 hour on coding and learning but at the moment it's impossible. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness again and again and again

<h1>Day 5: January 8th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: managed to set fixed menu so it won't overlap and becomes huge when resizing

Thougts: Took 3 hours to experiment with width but no good result or progress yet. Webpage looks perfect but when making it big - everything falls apart.Want to make it perfect. Found 2 webpages with great layout and responsiveness - learning on them. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness again and again and again and once more
