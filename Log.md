Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

Today's Progress: Deleted slider, instead created 6 block section with future projects. Added tribute page to past projects. Tried to use bootstrap but it messed whole markup. 

Thoughts: Cannot understand why after resizing text comes out of the borders, trying to understand the bug, will read about float and em. 

Work on in the future: Bootstrap. Understanding github. Fixing issue with out of borders text
