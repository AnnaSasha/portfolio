<h1>Day 1: January 2nd, 2017</h1>

Today's Progress: Deleted slider, instead created 6 block section with future projects. Added tribute page to past projects. Tried to use bootstrap but it messed whole markup. 

Thoughts: Cannot understand why after resizing text comes out of the borders, trying to understand the bug, will read about float and em. 

Work on in the future: Bootstrap. Understanding github. Fixing issue with out of borders text

<h1>Day 2: January 3rd, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: Finished with Projects section for now, social links with icons done. 

Thougts: Have troubles with responsive design. Thinking about functional footer - plan for tomorrow. Going through selectors tutorials and pseudo elements which is very helpful. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness and Bootstrap.

<h1>Day 3: January 4th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: practising Javascript and selectors.

Thougts: Javascript is very difficult for me, but not because I am stupid but because I cannot grasp the whole idea behind the language. Once I do, everything will be much easier. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness and Bootstrap+ Javascript and pseudo-elements which fascinate me

<h1>Day 4: January 5th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: struggling with footer and mirroring images - it appeares that easier to mirror it in Photoshop than CSS.

Thougts: Every day I want to spend more than 1 hour on coding and learning but at the moment it's impossible. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness again and again and again

<h1>Day 5: January 8th, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: managed to set fixed menu so it won't overlap and becomes huge when resizing

Thougts: Took 3 hours to experiment with width but no good result or progress yet. Webpage looks perfect but when making it big - everything falls apart.Want to make it perfect. Found 2 webpages with great layout and responsiveness - learning on them. 

Work on in the future: Responsiveness again and again and again and once more

<h1>Day 6-12: January 9th-16th, 2017</h1>

Progress: Potfolio is done, but haven't shared it yet, because at this point I like nothing about it, need to rest from it. Will get back to it in 2 days and check everything again with "clean" glance. A lot was done; I used viewpoints a lot instead pixels and percentages, I like how even at 500% resolution everything stays in place and has the same dimensions. But it got me thinking, what if I want to make it bigger or smaller, and it won't, it stays the same all the time. 
I also got back to my installed Ubunutu and I enjoy it more than Windows. When lines of command run on terminal it excites me. 

Plan: 
<ol>
<li>next HTML&CSS project won't have viewpoints, in order to learn how to make everything in place with different width and height tools.</li>
<li>To learn how Javascript works, a lot of numbers scare me and at the moment Javascript for me is all about numbers, but I need to know some basics, at least so I was able to understand someone else's code and get the functioning. Get on FreeCodeCamp Javascript assignments</li>
<li>Command Line and Terminal practise. Read more about it and practise coding in it, write some easy scriprs - will be usefull for work as well </li>

No links for today.

<h1>Day 13: January 26th, 2018</h1>

<p>Regress: I haven't done any code almost for a year. And you know why? Because I have my goals all wrong.</p> 

<p>History lesson: A couple of years ago, in 2015, I was a private Russian and Ukrainian language tutor. I decided to make a single web-page for my future studets to be able to find me and order some lessons. So I found some ancient video on youtube Make your own web page in 20 minutes, or something like that and I dove in. Maybe because I had a lot of free time back then, or because I was a sponge greedy for knowledge, but it was extremely interesting. I spent days learning, found awesome HTML academy lessons, even paid for Premium account for one month, which is unlikely for me because I am a greedy bitch. At noght I was dreaming abount those lessons and tests. I day-dreamed about myself being cool web-developer, programmer or whatever. I was not strong in terms, I'm still not. By the way. today is Januaru 2018 and I still do not have my single web page of a tutor, but I do have portfolio (LOL).</p>

<p>It is obvious that I messed up my goals and started doing stuff for all the wrong reasons.
At first it was like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is so freaking interesting</li>
	<li>I can create stuff from nothing</li>
	<li>My imagination is my limit</li>
	<li>WHen issue fised, you feel like God, and it is for free</li>
	<li>I can do this is an intoxicating feeling</li>
	<li>WHy I haven't started it earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on andd so on.</p>
<p>After couple of months, it became this</p>
<ul>
	<li>If I do this, I will earn a lot of money</li>
	<li>Gee, everyone is so stupid around me, and I'm the queen of the world</li>
	<li>I know nothing, why should I do it</li>
	<li>To gain something from it, I need to spend 10 hours coding</li>
</ul>
<p>You see what happened there? From being nice, fulfilling hobby, my desire to learn and code transformed in desire to make moneay and as soos as possible. I have no one but me to blame.</p>
<h1>This is hobby for me. Number one goal in it is - how it makes me feel. If I am bored or frustrated, I stop. If I am into it, I will get back to it, to fix whateve I have to fix. Money is good but it is not the goal. Meaningful life is. ANd coding is for free.</h1>
