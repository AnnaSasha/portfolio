<h1>Day 1: January 2nd, 2017</h1>

Today's Progress: Deleted slider, instead created 6 block section with future projects. Added tribute page to past projects. Tried to use bootstrap but it messed whole markup. 

Thoughts: Cannot understand why after resizing text comes out of the borders, trying to understand the bug, will read about float and em. 

Work on in the future: Bootstrap. Understanding github. Fixing issue with out of borders text

<h1>Day 2: January 3rd, 2017</h1>
Today's Progress: Finished with Projects section for now, social links with icons done. 

Thougts: Have troubles with responsive design. Thinking about functional footer - plan for today. Going through selectors tutorials and pseudo elements which is very helpful. 

Work on in the future. Responsiveness and Bootstrap.
